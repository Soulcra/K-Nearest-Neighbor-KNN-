# K-Nearest-Neighbor-KNN-
K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) Classifier is a supervised pattern classifier that determines the class of an input sample based on the distance to k nearest labeled neighbors. 

Write a program to perform supervised pattern classification using kNN classifiers. Your program should have two components: distance calculation and class assignment
